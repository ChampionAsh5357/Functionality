 * The interfaces in this package are annotated with {@link net.ashwork.functionality.util.InheritOnly}.
 * These are meant as the interface should only be inherited and never used directly as a functional interface.
 * You can obtain an abstract version of an interface from a declarable one, but it should not be constructed directly
 * as otherwise an error will most likely occur.

 * <p>This specific package (excluding subclasses) only holds the basic abstract {@code Functions}.
